# Tao of Rufus

The Tao of Rufus - how to get stuff done and find your path in life.

This serves as my comprehensive guide to life, ranging from the very high level like setting life goals to the low level like how to plan projects and track time. Currently, these materials are dispersed across various sources like the [Datopian Playbook](https://datopian.com/playbook/) and [Life Itself Tao](https://lifeitself.org/tao/), making it inconvenient to manage or refer to.

This project is a work in progress ðŸš§ to ... consolidate my scattered life guide materials into a single location. Aka "My Tao" or "My Principles" or "My playbook".
