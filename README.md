# Tao of Rufus

This is [Rufus Pollock's](https://rufuspollock) tao, or "way". 

It serves as my guide to life, ranging from the very high level like how to set life goals to how to plan projects and track time.

It is also a guide to what I stand for and how I go about things. It is distilled from the operating principles I've discovered over more than two decades running and being involved in multiple non-profits and businesses. 

Currently, these materials are dispersed across various sources like the [Datopian Playbook](https://datopian.com/playbook/) and [Life Itself Tao](https://lifeitself.org/tao/), making it inconvenient to manage or refer to. This project is a work in progress ðŸš§ to  consolidate my scattered life guide materials into a single location.

See the sidebar on the left for the materials available here so far.
