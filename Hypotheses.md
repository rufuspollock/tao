The **hypotheses principle**: when you have a question try to generate your own hypotheses for a solutoion _before_ seeking help or answers from someone else.

Why is creating hypotheses important when you have a question?

They help to develop:

- **Autonomy**: The ability to function on your own.
- **Capability**: Having the necessary tools to be autonomous.
- **Empowerment**: Feeling confident that you are capable and able to be autonomous.
- **Learning**: Rapidly learning and self development.

More specifically:

- When you're wrong about a hypothesis, you can learn where you made a mistake, or how to improve next time. You learn a lot more even when you're incorrect.
- It's good practice to come up with hypotheses when you're stuck, because you might come up with a working solution on your own.
- Writing out your hypotheses can help to clarify your thoughts.
    - Though questions can come from confusion, in clarifying your questions (even if only to yourself), it may lead to understanding the problem from a different perspective.
- They can enhance your analytical skill – being willing ask questions is a great tool, but learning how to form your own hypotheses without outside help is invaluable.
- When you ask questions without your own hypotheses, you remain stuck, and dependent on someone else.
- Coming up with hypotheses teaches you to break down problems into smaller, more manageable parts. This can also help you more easily understand where the gaps in your knowledge are.

## Examples

Suppose someone gives you a vaguely defined task e.g. "Improve the website". One option is to ask lots of questions e.g

- What is the definition of done? Do you have acceptance criteria?
- How much time should I spend on this?
- Are there existing plans and materials?

This is already good ... and *even better* is to start generating your own hypotheses for answers to these questions. Now these hypotheses don't have to be exactly right -- in fact, they almost certainly won't be -- but they will help move things forward much better.

For example, for first item you could up with 3-4 ideas for what the acceptance criteria are. Even if turns out they are way off base they will catalyse clarification from the other person.
