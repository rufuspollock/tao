# Standups

Standups are part of the [agile methodology][https://playbook.datopian.com/agile/]. Agile is a project management tool, and standups are a way of outlining what you intend to work on over the next 24 hours. Their purpose is to:

* Keep the team in sync
* Identify blockers 
* Deal with issues arising (e.g. need to reprioritize in the face of an arising issue or change in estimate)

Traditionally, standups are done verbally "in person" (in a live team meeting e.g. on video).

* Plan (What is your plan for the next 24 hours?)
* Recap (What did you accomplish during the last 24 hours?)
* Blockers (Is there something getting in the way of you completing your tasks)
* Availability (What is your availability for the next 24 hours?)

```md
* Last 24h: ...
* Next 24h: ...
* Blockers: ...
* Availability: ...
```
