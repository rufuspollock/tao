# Standups

Standups are part of the [agile methodology](https://playbook.datopian.com/agile/). Agile is a project management tool, and standups are a way of outlining what you intend to work on over the next 24 hours. Their purpose is to:

* Keep the team in sync
* Identify blockers 
* Deal with issues arising (e.g. need to reprioritize in the face of an arising issue or change in estimate)

Traditionally, standups were done verbally "in person" or live in a team meeting e.g. on video). However, in distributed asynchronous teams it can be common to do these asynchronously via e.g. shared team chat. 

* Recap (What did you accomplish during the last 24 hours?)
* Plan (What is your plan for the next 24 hours?)
* Blockers (Is there something getting in the way of you completing your tasks)
* [Optional] Availability (What is your availability for the next 24 hours?) [This is optional and only used to flag if someone will *not* be available at their usual times]

Here's a template to use for posting 

```md
- Last 24h: ...
- Next 24h: ...
- Blockers: ...
- Availability: ...
```
