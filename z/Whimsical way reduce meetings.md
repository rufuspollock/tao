Relevant for [[Meetings]].

> ### Reduce meetings
>
> High-value, cognitively demanding activities—like coding, writing, designing, strategizing, and problem-solving—require long periods of uninterrupted focus. To make more time for what truly matters, here’s how to cut down on unnecessary meetings:

| Old way                                           | New way (The Whimsical Way)       |
|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Status update meetings** (stand-ups, project updates, etc.) | - Use [Posts](#) to share status updates asynchronously to keep everyone aligned  <br /> - For recurring updates, create reusable [post templates](#) to streamline the process and save time                                                                             |
| **Feedback/review meetings** (design review, content review, etc.) | - Record a video walkthrough (e.g., using Loom) of the work to provide context to reviewers  <br /> - Embed the video walkthrough in the discussion section inside the related task or in a post to share with team members  <br /> - Produces more thoughtful feedback, removes the pressure of live meetings, and keeps the discussion documented in a central place |
| **Brainstorm sessions**                          | - Use [Boards](#) to create a space where team members can contribute ideas asynchronously  <br /> - Team members can add ideas, organize thoughts, and build on each other’s input at their own pace  <br /> - Meeting owner can summarize, refine options, and invite voting or further collaboration              |
| **Planning meetings**                            | - Use [Docs](#) to outline goals, priorities, and next steps asynchronously  <br /> - Invite team members to add comments, suggestions, or edits on their own time  <br /> - Once aligned, share a clear plan of action with everyone                                       |
| **Retrospectives**                               | - Use a board or doc to collect feedback, wins, and improvement areas asynchronously  <br /> - Team members contribute at their own pace, creating space for thoughtful reflection  <br /> - Summarize key takeaways in [posts](#) to share learnings and insights            |
| **Decision-making discussions**                  | - Use comments to gather input and feedback directly where work happens to keep things in context  <br /> - Use Posts to summarize options, decisions, and next steps (e.g., in a post category called “Decisions”)  <br /> - Async decision-making ensures everyone is informed without long live discussions  <br /> - Document decisions in a place everyone can access to maintain team alignment, momentum, and accountability |
